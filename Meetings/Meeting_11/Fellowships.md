### Further Resources

The UW-Madison Physics Department keeps a [list of the main fellowships for graduate students](https://www.physics.wisc.edu/graduate/current-phd-students/phd-resources/#fellowships-and-funding) on its website. You can find IBM, Microsoft, QISE-NET, NASA, and Google. Some of these have passed their deadline and are not included in the above list, but may be of interest in the future.

Often other physics departments will provide a list of fellowships similar to the UW-Madison page, and you may find different lists of felloships depending on where you look.

The [Wisconsin Space Grant Consortium Graduate & Professional Research Fellowship](https://spacegrant.carthage.edu/funding-programs/research/wsgc-fellowship/), while currently passed for this year, is less competitive than national fellowships and targeted towards astronomy, astrophysics, particle astrophysics, and cosmology research.

The American Physical Society (APS) keeps [a list of graduate fellowships and internships](https://www.aps.org/careers/employment/internships.cfm) on their website.
