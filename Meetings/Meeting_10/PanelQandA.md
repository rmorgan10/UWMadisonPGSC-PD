**Question**: How to address "Broader Impacts"-like questions and connect them to your research?

**Answer**: Helpful to integrate your broader imact activity with your research. Diversity and inclusion is sometimes a good way to go about this by mentioning how your research will be beneficial to success in physics of individuals in underrepresented groups. The use of your research to effect change in society is also a good strategy. Be careful to avoid proposing something that is too far-fetched; if your borader impacts don't seem feasible it will hurt your proposal. Reviewers will see through loose connections, so take the borader impact part of an application very seriously to avoid constructing a loose connection as you're up against a deadline.

**Question**: How much do reviewers weight the proposed research content versus funding the individual?

**Answer**: One perspective: Having a compelling and well-communicated proposed research proposal can certianly outweigh a track record, but this varies fellowship to fellowship. It is good to ask your advisor for advice on this, since they will be closer to the field and specific fellowship of interest. Often this imformation is contained in a personal statement part of the application, and what reviewers are looking for is not the name of the institution / advisor, but rather indicating your awareness of the feasibility of the project and depth of knowledge on the topic.
