# Panel Questions and Answers

**Question**: Can you introduce yourself? What physics did you do at UW-Madison, what kind of work do you do now?

**Answer**:

- Chris: Observational X-Ray astronomy, then postdoc, now software developer
- Adam: Quantum computing, software developer at Epic, 
- Matt: Quantum computing, scientist at IBM
- Dan: High Energy, self-employed
- Jon: WIPAC, data scientist

**Question**: How far in advance did you start your job search?

**Answer**:

- Adam: I started 6 months in advance
- Matt: The bigger companies I was applying to take longer, so go ahead and start earlier (8-9 months). Your start date will usually be negotiable
- Jon: I started over a year in advance, but I had a safety net of a postdoc so I wasn't very rushed

**Question**: What about your PhD was worth it?

**Answer**:

- The letters after your name carry a lot of weight in hiring and attainable jobs
- Getting the PhD teaches you how to solve problems. That shows hiring committees that they can give you hard things.
- PhDs have more freedom in projects
- As a PhD, often you are the person making decisions

**Question**: How does making decisions in corporate compare to making scientific judgements in your research?

**Answer**:

- Corporate decisions often require more interpersonal skills
- You have to make business decisions instead of research decisions 
- a little bit of autonomy is lost (sometimes you don't get to choose your projects, you have more constraints)
- Being "right" in corporate world doesn't hold as much weight as it does in grad school. You have to play politics more

**Question**: Do you have any tips for salary negotiations?

**Answer**:

- Get multiple offers so that you can leverage one against the other
- It's always worth having a discussion about salary. You're basically being paid $10,000 more a year for a single uncomfortable conversation
- The worst they say is no and they probably won't rescind the offer, especially after going through the trouble of interviewing you. They usually anticipate that you'll ask for more. 
- Once already in a job, prepare to have an "end of first year conversation" with a list of accomplishments, showing that you exceeded expectations, to negotiate for a raise
- Ask someone else who went into industry if your salary offer is on par with common trends, or check online for that info (e.g., Glassdoor). 
- Use cost of living when comparing one offer to another

**Question**: For those of you who did practice interviews, how?

**Answer**:

- Career services at UW-Madison will interview you for any job posting for free
- Practice on your significant other, roommates, friends, advisor, etc. The biggest hurdle is getting comfortable talking about yourself


**Question**: Will interviews in tech-related fields have a live coding component?

**Answer**:

- Yes.
- You should take courses in data structures and algorithms, or independently review the materials for those courses
- You can find several books about programming interviews (e.g. "Cracking the coding interview")
- There are practice websites that simulate the coding aspects of interviews (e.g. "Hackerite.com")
- Practice solving programming interview questions on a whiteboard, this may be how the coding interview is orchestrated

**Question**: What skills are external to the PhD program but are generally required to make you a competitive job applicant?

**Answer**:

- Git or other version control
- SQL
- Microsoft Office

**Question**: Would you have done anything differently in grad school?

**Answer**:

- I was enjoying it, and it got me here so no
- It's important that your time in graduate school shows you how to think about problems instead of being able to do what you're asked
- Use more industry-standard tools in your research, look for what jobs are asking for and try to incorporate them into your research to get familiar with it

**Question**: What are your longest and shortest jobs? How unstable is the private sector?

**Answer**:

- You rarely get huge raises in industry. Often you change jobs because you're looking for a higher salary, and that is not regarded negatively
- Typically hold each job for a few years at a time
- There is volitivity, but it is not unmanageable

**Question**: Where do you look for jobs?

**Answer**:

- To apply, find someone you know in that industry and ask them where to find opportunities.  You can parachute (ask your friends (A List), your friends of friends (B list), your friends of friends of friends (C list), etc)
- Applying to things cold has a pretty low success rate (but can still work!). When you submit a resume, if the right words aren't there then it gets tossed. Then an HR person looks at it. Talking to someone who works at the company is much easier. 
- Use LinkedIn to talk to potential people / recruiters
- Check all the boxes if you do apply to an automated application. "Check Masters in Environmental science then in your cover letter say 'I may not have that, but I have a masters and am enthusiastic about environment'". Your goal is to get passed their filtering algorithm.


**Question**: What piece of advice would you give to your graduate school self?

**Answer**:

Matthew Beck: If you study a hot topic, you are among many many others so make a claim for yourself. At IBM they asked me "What part of this work did you do?" and I replied "all of it" and that left an impression. While in PhD do everything all the time so you can get a job afterwards where you don't have to do that.

Adam Frees: Developing a wide breadth of knowledge is invaluable. 

Chris: Be confident that the skills you've learned will serve you well and use that to sell yourself. Fight for that initial salary. It takes a while to catch up if you don't. Be your own advocate.

Jon: Don't be too arrogant or high minded coming out of Academia. If you look down on industry you will be set back. 

Dan: No matter how low on the ladder an employee is, talk to them, store favors. All connections will help you. When the time comes and you need help, having more friends in the company is good.
