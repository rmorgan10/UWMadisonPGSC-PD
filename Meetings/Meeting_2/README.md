# The Job Market

### Meeting 2

This week, we'll take a data-driven look at the job market for graduating Physics PhDs.

The skills you'll learn pursuing your PhD will be widely-applicable and make you a good candidate for jobs in several industries.
To go from good to great, there are additional skills that employers want that you can learn while in graduate school.
We'll cover all the skills needed to start heading down any career path and introduce [DiscoverPD](https://my.grad.wisc.edu/DiscoverPD), a UW-Madison tool for tracking your skills.
